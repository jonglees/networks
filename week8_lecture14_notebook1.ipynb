    "Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a genome-wide expression analysis method designed to interpret expression profiles focusing on pre-defined gene sets [(Subramanian et al., 2005)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506580102). These gene sets are curated based on prior biological knowledge, such as published information about biochemical pathways or patterns of coexpression observed in previous experimental studies. The genes can be ordered in a ranked list, according to their differential expression between the classes. The primary objective of GSEA is to assess whether the genes within a given gene set tend to occur toward the top (or bottom) of the ranked list. This ranking is based on the correlation between gene expression and a particular phenotypic class distinction. By evaluating the distribution of gene set members within the ranked list, GSEA identifies whether the set is correlated with the phenotypic class, thus providing insights into underlying biological mechanisms. This method contrasts with traditional single-gene analysis by focusing on the collective behavior of gene sets, thereby uncovering biologically significant patterns that might be overlooked when examining individual genes in isolation. We use `gseapy` to perform GSEA with various gene sets from the MSigDB Database."
